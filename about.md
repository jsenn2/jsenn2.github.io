Hey there! I'm a PhD candidate at the University of Lausanne, where I'm neck-deep in the fascinating world of sociology, particularly focusing on the sociology of religion. My work mainly revolves around the National Congregation Study Switzerland, where I get to dive into how local religious groups evolve over time. I'm passionate about understanding these dynamics and have had the opportunity to share my insights through various publications and conferences.

My academic journey has been a mix of exploring religious diversity, secularization, and the changing face of congregations. I've published articles in journals and presented my findings at international conferences, always with a keen eye on the evolving religious landscape in Switzerland. 

In the realm of research, my true love lies in quantitative methods, especially using R. Beyond that, I really enjoy chess and walking.

Beyond the world of academia, I've also engaged with wider audiences through newspaper articles and radio interviews, discussing topics like the growth of non-religious populations and the reasons behind the shifting religious sentiments in society. Beyond that, I really enjoy chess and walking.
