Hey there! I'm a PhD candidate at the University of Lausanne, where I'm neck-deep in the fascinating world of sociology, particularly focusing on the sociology of religion. My work mainly revolves around the National Congregation Study Switzerland, where I get to dive into how local religious groups evolve over time. I'm passionate about understanding these dynamics and have had the opportunity to share my insights through various publications and conferences.

My academic journey has been a mix of exploring religious diversity, secularization, and the changing face of congregations. I've published articles in journals and presented my findings at international conferences. In the realm of research, my true love lies in quantitative methods, especially using R. 

In my empirical work, I keep analytical levels distinct, which allows me to break down complex phenomena into macro dynamics (such as overall trends across religious denominations) and micro dynamics (such as the trajectories of individual local groups). This helps avoid projecting inferences drawn at one level onto another. I also turn to simulations to test my explanations, explore counterfactual scenarios, and quantify how simple micro-rules can, over time, generate the macro configurations observed in the data.

Beyond that, I really enjoy chess and walking.
